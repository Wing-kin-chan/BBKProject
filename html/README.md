Biocomputing II / html
======================

This directory contains only the HTML file for the initial view of the
database.

There would be an `html2` directory if there is an alternative front end.

In this example, it has been implemented as a Python script so it can
access the configuration information - running this script generates
the HTML (this is done by the install script).

The Search by allows you to narrow the focus of the search with details like the Genbank Accession, the Gene Identifier, Protein Product and the Chromosomal Location.

Once you hit search the results are displayed giving the Protein Product Name, the Conformation, Overhang, Minimum Site Lenght, Maximum Number of Cuts, Freqeuncy Cut Positions and other details.
